      "### 58 \n\n#### Appendix 2 Enquiries 67 \n\n\n### Foreword \n\nThis guide sets out in simple terms the main provisions of the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57). It should be noted that the Ordinance itself remains the sole authority for the provisions of the law explained. Please refer to Appendix 2 for enquiries services. This version is finalised in December 2023. Contents of this guide may be amended from time to time where necessary. The latest version of the guide is available at the Labour Department‚Äôs web page: [http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/ConciseGuide.htm](http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/ConciseGuide.htm) \n\n\n### Chapter 1: Application of the Employment Ordinance \n\nThe Employment Ordinance applies to all employees with the following exceptions: \n\n1. a family member who lives in the same dwelling as the employer; \n\n2. an employee as defined in the Contracts for Employment Outside Hong     Kong Ordinance; \n\n3. a person serving under a crew agreement under the Merchant Shipping  ",
      "   (Seafarers) Ordinance, or on board a ship which is not registered in Hong     Kong; and \n\n4. an apprentice whose contract of apprenticeship has been registered under     the Apprenticeship Ordinance, other than certain provisions of the     Employment Ordinance. All employees covered by the Employment Ordinance, irrespective of their hours of work, are entitled to basic protection under the Ordinance including payment of wages, restrictions on wages deductions and the granting of statutory holidays, etc. Employees who are employed under a continuous contract are further entitled to such benefits as rest days, paid annual leave, sickness allowance, severance payment and long service payment, etc. **Continuous Contract of Employment** An employee who has been employed continuously by the same employer for four weeks or more, with at least 18 hours worked in each week is regarded as being employed under a continuous contract. In any dispute as to whether a contract of employment is a c",
      "ontinuous contract, the onus of proving that it is not a continuous contract shall be on the employer. \n\n\n### Chapter 2: Contract of Employment \n\n A contract of employment is an agreement on the employment conditions made between an employer and an employee. The agreement can be made orally or in writing and it includes both express and implied terms. Employers and employees are free to negotiate and agree on the terms and conditions of employment provided that they do not violate the provisions of the Employment Ordinance. Any term of an employment contract which purports to extinguish or reduce any right, benefit or protection conferred upon the employee by this Ordinance shall be void. Information on Conditions of Service Before employment begins, an employer must inform each employee clearly of the conditions of employment under which he is to be employed with regard to: \n\n1. wages (including rate of wages, overtime rate and any allowances, whether     calculated by piece, job, hou",
      "r, day, week or otherwise); \n\n2. wage period; \n\n3. length of notice required to terminate the contract; and \n\n4. if the employee is entitled to an end of year payment, the end of year     payment or proportion and the payment period. If the contract of employment is in writing, the employer shall give one copy of the written contract to the employee for retention and reference. If the contract of employment is not in writing, the employer shall provide the employee with such information in writing if the employee, before such employment is entered into, makes a written request. Whenever there is any change in the conditions of service, whether these have merely been proposed to an employee or are actually in force, the employer shall inform him in an intelligible manner. If such change to conditions of service is in writing or upon the written request from the employee, a copy of the written amendment must be provided to the employee. \n\n\n**NOTE:** Statutory entitlements such as holiday",
      " pay, annual leave pay, sickness allowance, maternity leave pay and paternity leave pay are calculated on the basis of wages, particulars of which are established by the terms of employment contracts. Employers and employees should clearly understand the wage components (for example, commission, allowance, etc), wage rate, conditions and arrangements for payment, etc. **Duration of Employment Contract** In the absence of any express agreement to the contrary, every contract of employment which is a continuous contract is deemed to be a contract for one month and renewable from month to month. **Wage and Employment Records** Every employer must at all times keep a record setting out the wage and employment history of each employee covering the period of his employment during the preceding 12 months. The record should include the following information of the employee: \n\n1. name and identity card number; \n\n2. date of commencement of employment; \n\n3. job title; \n\n4. wages paid in respect o",
      "f each wage period; \n\n5. total number of hours worked in each wage period (if applicable*); \n\n6. wage period; \n\n7. periods of annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, paternity leave and     holidays entitled and taken, together with details of payments made in     respect of such periods; \n\n8. amount of end of year payment and the period to which it relates (if     applicable); \n\n9. period of notice required for termination of contract; \n\n10. date of termination of employment (if applicable).     * For details, please refer to the ‚ÄúConcise Guide to Statutory Minimum Wage‚Äù        published by the Labour Department. This guide book can be downloaded        from the homepage of the Labour Department (www.labour.gov.hk) or        obtained at the Offices of the Labour Relations Division of the Labour        Department. \n\n\nThe wage and employment records must be kept at the employer‚Äôs place of business or at the place where the employee is employed, and they should also be kept for a peri",
      "od of another six months after the employee ceases to be employed. **NOTE:** ÔÇü Employers should keep proper records in relation to employees‚Äô attendance, leave and wages, etc for the purpose of calculating statutory entitlements. ÔÇü To safeguard their own rights and benefits, employees should also keep proper records in relation to their attendance, leave and wages, etc. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who fails to keep the above record is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $10,000. Officers of the Labour Department may inspect the above record, inquire any person or seize anything which may appear to be evidence of an offence under the Employment Ordinance. Any person who fails to comply with the requirements of the officers of the Labour Department is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $100,000 and to imprisonment for one year. \n\n\n### Chapter 3 : Wages \n\n**Definition** \"Wages\" means all remuneration, earnings, allowances, tips and ser",
      "vice charges, however designated or calculated, payable to an employee in respect of work done or work to be done, and capable of being expressed in terms of money. Allowances including travelling allowances, attendance allowances, commission and overtime pay are within the definition of wages. However, it does not include: \n\n1. the value of any accommodation, education, food, fuel, water, light or     medical care provided by the employer; \n\n2. employer's contribution to any retirement scheme; \n\n3. commission, attendance allowance or attendance bonus which is of a     gratuitous nature or is payable only at the discretion of the employer; \n\n4. non-recurrent travelling allowance or the value of any travelling concession     or travelling allowance for actual expenses incurred by the employment; \n\n5. any sum payable to the employee to defray special expenses incurred by     him by the nature of his employment; \n\n6. end of year payment, or annual bonus which is of a gratuitous nature or ",
      "is     payable only at the discretion of the employer; \n\n7. gratuity payable on completion or termination of a contract of employment. An employee's entitlements to end of year payment, maternity leave pay, paternity leave pay, severance payment, long service payment, sickness allowance, holiday pay, annual leave pay and payment in lieu of notice are calculated according to the above definition of wages. Overtime pay should also be included in calculating the above payments if: \n\n- it is of a constant character; or \n\n- its monthly average over the past 12 months is not less than 20% of the     average monthly wages of the employee during the same period. \n\n\n**Deductions from Wages** An employer is prohibited from deducting wages from his employee, except under the following circumstances: \n\n1. deductions for absence from work. The sum to be deducted should be     proportionate to the period of time the employee is absent from work; \n\n2. deductions for damage to or loss of the employer'",
      "s goods, equipment, or     property by the employee's neglect or default. In any one case, the sum to     be deducted shall be equivalent to the value of the damage or loss but not     exceeding $300. The total of such deductions shall not exceed one quarter     of the wages payable to the employee in that wage period; \n\n3. deductions for the recovery of any advanced or over-paid wages to the     employee. The total sum to be deducted shall not exceed one quarter of the     wages payable to the employee in that wage period; \n\n4. deductions of the value of food and accommodation the employer supplies     to the employee; \n\n5. deductions, at the written request of the employee, in respect of contributions     to be paid by the employee through the employer for any medical scheme,     superannuation scheme, retirement scheme or thrift scheme; \n\n6. deductions, with the employee's written consent, for the recovery of any loan     made by the employer to the employee; \n\n7. deductions in resp",
      "ect of paternity leave pay paid to the employee before the     required document is provided if the employee fails to provide the employer     with the required document within 3 months after the first day of paternity     leave taken, or if the employee has ceased to be employed, fails to provide     the required document before the cessation; \n\n8. deductions which are required or authorized under any enactment to be     made from the wages of the employee; \n\n9. deductions for outstanding maintenance payment owed by the employee     pursuant to the Attachment of Income Order issued by the court. Deductions under items (1) to (8) shall have priority over item (9). Unless with the approval in writing of the Commissioner for Labour, the total of all deductions, except those for absence from work and outstanding maintenance payment, made in any one wage period shall not exceed one half of the wages payable in that period. \n\n\n**Offences and Penalties** An employer who makes illegal deducti",
      "on from wages of an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $100,000 and to imprisonment for one year. **Payment of Wages** Wages shall become due on the expiry of the last day of the wage period. An employer should pay wages to an employee as soon as practicable but in any case not later than seven days after the end of the wage period. An employer is required to pay interest on the outstanding amount of wages to the employee if he fails to pay wages to the employee within seven days when it becomes due. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay wages to an employee when it becomes due is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $350,000 and to imprisonment for three years. Where a wage offence committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other simi",
      "lar officer of the body corporate, such person shall be guilty of the like offence and, upon conviction, is liable to the same penalty. An employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay interest on the outstanding amount of wages to the employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $10,000. **Failure to Pay Wages** An employer who is no longer able to pay wages due should terminate the contract of employment in accordance with its terms. If wages are not paid within one month after they become due, an employee may deem his contract of employment to be terminated by his employer without notice and is entitled to payment in lieu of notice in addition to other statutory and contractual termination payment. To avoid disputes, an employee should inform his employer when he exercises such rights under the Ordinance. \n\n\n**Liability to Pay Wages of Sub-contractor's Employees** The principal contractors, superior sub-contractors and superior nominated su",
      "bcontractors engaged in building and construction works are liable for the first two months' unpaid wages of an employee who is employed by the sub-contractor or nominated sub-contractor. If an employee employed by a sub-contractor or nominated sub-contractor is owed wages, he must serve a written notice to the principal contractor or the main nominated sub-contractor within 60 days (or an additional period of 90 days permitted by the Commissioner for Labour) after the wages become due. The employee should state the following in the notice: \n\n1. the name and address of the employee; \n\n2. the name and address of his employer; \n\n3. the address of the place of employment of the employee; \n\n4. the particulars of the work in respect of which the wages are due; and \n\n5. the amount of wages due and the period to which they relate. The principal contractors, the superior sub-contractors and the superior nominated sub-contractors should pay wages to the employee within 30 days after receiving t",
      "he notice. They may request every superior sub-contractor or superior nominated sub-contractor to the employee's employer to share out the liability. The wages paid by the principal contractor, the superior sub-contractors and the superior nominated sub-contractors shall be a debt due by the employer of the employee to them. The debt may be recovered through civil claims proceedings. \n\n\n### Chapter 4: Rest Days, Holidays and Leave \n\nAn employee shall enjoy rest days, statutory holidays and paid annual leave during employment. **REST DAY Eligibility for Rest Day** An employee employed under a continuous contract is entitled to not less than one rest day in every period of seven days. **Definition of a Rest Day** A rest day is defined as a continuous period of not less than 24 hours during which an employee is entitled to abstain from working for his employer. **Appointment of Rest Days** Rest days shall be appointed by the employer. They may be granted on a regular or irregular basis: \n",
      "\nÔÇü regular rest days (^) the employer should inform his employees of the arrangement ÔÇü irregular rest days before the beginning of each month, the employer must inform his employees orally or in writing of the appointed rest days or by displaying a roster showing the dates of the appointed rest days for each employee An employer may substitute some other rest day with the consent of the employee, in which case it must be within the same month before the original rest day or within 30 days after it. **Compulsory Work on Rest days** An employer must not compel an employee to work on a rest day except in the event of a breakdown of machinery or plant or in any other unforeseen emergency. For any rest day on which the employee is required to work, the employer should substitute some other rest day within 30 days after the original rest day. The employer should notify the employee of the arrangement within 48 hours after the employee is required to work. \n\n\n**Offences and Penalties** An emp",
      "loyer who without reasonable excuse fails to grant rest days to his employees is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. An employer who compels his employees to work on their rest days is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. **Voluntary Work on Rest Days** An employee, except young persons under the age of 18 employed in industrial undertakings, may work voluntarily on a rest day. Any condition in a contract of employment which makes payment of any type of annual bonus or end of year payment conditional on an employee agreeing to work on rest days is void. **Rest Day Pay** Whether a rest day is paid or not is to be agreed by employers and employees. **STATUTORY HOLIDAYS** An employee, irrespective of his length of service, is entitled to the following statutory holidays: \n\n1. the first day of January \n\n2. Lunar New Year's Day \n\n3. the second day of Lunar New Year \n\n4. the third day of Lunar New Year \n\n5. Ching Ming Festival \n\n6. L",

Chinese Winter Solstice Festival or Christmas Day (at the option of the     employer) \n\n14. the first weekday after Christmas Day _(newly added from 202 4 )* *Effective from 1 January 202 4_ \n\n\nThe additional statutory holidays from 202 6 and thereafter are tabulated as follows: **Year Newly added statutory holiday Total number of statutory holidays** Starting from 2026 Easter Monday 15 Starting from 2028 Good Friday 16 Starting from 2030 The day following Good Friday 17 (Regarding payment for statutory holiday, please see the part below on ‚ÄúHoliday Pay‚Äù) **Work on Statutory Holidays** If the employer requires the employee to work on a st",
      "atutory holiday, the employer should make the following arrangement: **Alternative Holiday Arrangement Prior Notice to Employee on the Date of Alternative Holiday** An alternative holiday should be arranged within 60 days before the statutory holiday; or To be given not less than 48 hours' prior notice before the alternative holiday An alternative holiday should be arranged within 60 days after the statutory holiday To be given not less than 48 hours' prior notice before the statutory holiday If the employer and employee agree, any day within 30 days before or after the statutory or alternative holiday may be taken by the employee as a substituted holiday. **A Statutory Holiday Falling on a Rest Day** If a statutory holiday falls on a rest day, the employee should be granted a holiday on the next day which is not a statutory holiday or an alternative holiday or a substituted holiday or a rest day. \n\n\n**Holiday Pay** An employee having been employed under a continuous contract for not l",
      "ess than three months immediately preceding a statutory holiday is entitled to the holiday pay. Holiday pay should be paid to the employee not later than the day on which he is next paid his wages after that statutory holiday. The daily rate of holiday pay is a sum equivalent to the average daily wages earned by an employee in the 12-month period preceding the following specified dates. If an employee is employed for less than 12 months, the calculation shall be based on the shorter period. \n\n**Day(s) of Statutory Holiday(s)** (^) **Specified Dates** 1 day Day of the statutory holiday More than 1 consecutive day First day of the statutory holidays **NOTE:** In calculating the average daily wages, an employer has to exclude (i) the periods for which an employee is not paid his wages or full wages, including rest day, statutory holiday, annual leave, sickness day, maternity leave, paternity leave, sick leave due to work injuries or leave taken with the agreement of the employer, and any ",
      "normal working day on which the employee is not provided by the employer with work; together with (ii) the sum paid to the employee for such periods. (see Appendix 1 for details) **Restriction on Pay in lieu of Holiday** Regardless of whether an employee is entitled to holiday pay, an employer should grant his employee a statutory holiday, or arrange an ‚Äúalternative holiday‚Äù or ‚Äúsubstituted holiday‚Äù. An employer must not make any form of payment to the employee in lieu of granting a holiday. In other words, ‚Äúbuy-out‚Äù of a holiday is not allowed. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to grant statutory holidays, alternative holidays or substituted holidays, or fails to pay holiday pay to an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. \n\n\n##### PAID ANNUAL LEAVE \n\nAn employee is entitled to annual leave with pay after having been employed under a continuous contract for every 12 months. An employee's entitlement to pai",
      "d annual leave increases progressively from seven days to a maximum of 14 days according to his length of service: **Years of Service Annual Leave Entitlements** 1 7 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10 6 11 7 12 8 13 9 or above 14 **Granting of Annual Leave** An employee shall take the paid annual leave to which he is entitled within the following period of 12 months. The time of the leave should be appointed by the employer after consultation with the employee or his representative, confirmed by a written notice to the employee at least 14 days in advance, unless a shorter period has been mutually agreed. Paid annual leave should be granted for an unbroken period. If the employee so requests, it may be granted in the following manner: **Leave entitlement not exceeding 10 days** up to 3 days can be granted separately; the balance should be granted consecutively **Leave entitlement exceeding 10 days** at least 7 days should be granted consecutively Any rest day or statutory holiday falling within a period",
      " of annual leave will be counted as annual leave and another rest day or holiday must be appointed. \n\n\n**Annual Leave Pay** The daily rate of annual leave pay is a sum equivalent to the average daily wages earned by an employee in the 12-month period preceding the following specified dates. If an employee is employed for less than 12 months, the calculation shall be based on the shorter period. **Day(s) of Annual Leave Specified Dates** 1 day Day of the annual leave More than 1 consecutive day First day of the annual leave **NOTE:** In calculating the average daily wages, an employer has to exclude (i) the periods for which an employee is not paid his wages or full wages, including rest day, statutory holiday, annual leave, sickness day, maternity leave, paternity leave, sick leave due to work injuries or leave taken with the agreement of the employer, and any normal working day on which the employee is not provided by the employer with work; together with (ii) the sum paid to the empl",
      "oyee for such periods. (see Appendix 1 for details) Annual leave pay should be paid to the employee not later than the normal pay day after the period of annual leave taken. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to grant annual leave to an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. An employer who fails to pay annual leave pay to an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. **Restriction on Pay in lieu of Leave** An employee may choose to accept payment in lieu of the part of his leave entitlement which exceeds 10 days. **Payment of Annual Leave Pay on Termination of Employment Contract** A leave year means any period of 12 months commencing on the day on which his employment commenced and an anniversary of such day. If an employee has been employed for a leave year and his employment contract is terminated, irrespective of the reasons of termination, he should be entitled to pay",
      "ment in lieu of any annual leave not yet taken. In calculating the daily rate of the payment, the ‚Äúdate of termination of contract‚Äù should be adopted as the ‚Äúspecified date‚Äù. (see the preceding part on ‚ÄúAnnual Leave Pay‚Äù) \n\n\nAn employee with three but less than 12 months' employment in a leave year and his employment contract is terminated other than for the reason of summary dismissal due to his serious misconduct, he would be entitled to pro rata annual leave pay. Calculation of Annual Leave Pay on Termination of Employment Contract: **Period of Employment Annual Leave Entitlements** Less than 12 months less than 3 months Nil 3 to 12 months summary dismissal Nil resignation dismissed other than summary dismissal 12 or more than 12 months less than 3 months in the current leave year annual leave not yet taken* 3 to 12 months in the current leave year summary dismissal annual leave not yet taken* resignation dismissed other than summary dismissal * This refers to any untaken annual lea",
      "ve accrued in the previous leave year. annual leave entitled in the current leave year period of employment (days) 365 x annual leave not yet taken* period of employment in the current leave year (days) 365 \n\n##### + \n\n annual leave entitled in the current leave year x \n\n\n**Common Leave Year** An employer may elect any period of 12 consecutive months as the common leave year for all of his employees. Should the employer wish to make this arrangement, he shall give one month's notice either to each of his employees in writing or by posting a notice in a conspicuous place in the place of employment. If an employee has not been employed for 12 months in the common leave year, the employer should calculate his leave entitlement on a pro rata basis, and any fraction of a day resulting from the calculation should be counted as a full day's leave. After consultation with his employer, the employee may opt to take the pro rata annual leave accrued preceding the commencement of the common leave",
      " year or carry it forward and combine it with his leave accrued in the next leave year. [Example] common leave year: 1.1.20 22 to 31.12.20 22 commencement date of employment: 1.9.20 22 pro rata annual leave: 122* / 365 X 7 = 2.34 days (round up to 3 days) (*122 is the number of days between 1.9.20 22 and 31.12.20 22 ) The employee may take the 3 days' leave in 20 23 , or combine it with his 7 days' leave accrued in 20 23 and take 10 days' leave in 20 24. **Annual Leave Shutdown** If an employer intends to close down his business or part of his business for granting annual leave to his employees, he should inform the affected employees in writing at least one month in advance. Where an employee is not yet entitled to paid annual leave in respect of any day during the period of shutdown but he has to stop work as a result, he should be granted paid annual leave during that whole period. If the annual leave an employee is entitled exceeds the number of days of shutdown, he may take the re",
      "maining annual leave immediately following the shutdown. The common leave year elected by the employer should not be affected by an annual leave shutdown as the annual leave granted shall be in respect of the leave year immediately preceding the period of the shutdown. \n\n\n### Chapter 5: Sickness Allowance \n\n**Eligibility for Sickness Allowance** An employee employed under a continuous contract is entitled to sickness allowance if the following conditions are fulfilled: \n\n1. the sick leave taken is not less than four consecutive days (unless for any day     off taken by a female employee for her pregnancy check-ups, post confinement     medical treatment or miscarriage, any such day on which she is absent shall be     counted as a sickness day and, subject to the following conditions, be paid     sickness allowance); \n\n2. the employee has accumulated sufficient number of paid sickness days (see the     parts below on ‚ÄúAccumulation of Paid Sickness Days‚Äù and ‚ÄúTwo Categories of     Paid S",
      "ickness Days‚Äù); and \n\n3. the sick leave is supported by:     (i) an appropriate medical certificate (regarding an employee‚Äôs medical        examination in relation to her pregnancy, may also be supported by a        certificate of attendance^1 apart from a medical certificate); or     (ii) regarding the absence from work of an employee by reason of his / her        compliance with a specific anti-epidemic requirement with a movement        restriction imposed under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance        (Cap. 599), the employee is required to produce a proof of such        requirement^2 (see the part below on ‚ÄúTwo Categories of Paid Sickness        Days‚Äù). \n\n(^1) Certificate of attendance is not applicable to an employee‚Äôs medical examination in relation to her pregnancy conducted before 11 December 2020.

      " of days from the day after the expected date of     confinement to the actual date of confinement; \n\n- an additional period of leave for not more than four weeks on the grounds of     illness or disability due to the pregnancy or confinement. **Taking of Maternity Leave** \n\n1. With the agreement of her employer, a pregnant employee may decide to     commence her maternity leave from two to four weeks before the expected     date of confinement. \n\n2. If the employee does not decide on the date, or fails to secure her employer's     agreement, the employee shall commence her maternity leave four weeks     before the expected date of confinement. Maternity leave commences on the date of confinement if it occurs before the above scheduled maternity leave. In this case, the employee should give notice of the date of confinement and her intention to take 14 weeks' maternity leave to her employer within seven days of her confinement. **NOTE:** Confinement means the delivery of a child; misca",
      "rriage means the expulsion of the products of conception which are incapable of survival after being born before 24 2 weeks of pregnancy. If before 24 weeks of pregnancy an employee delivers a surviving child or the child prematurely dies after being born, it is not a case of miscarriage. \n\n(^1) Eligible employees whose confinement occurs before 11 December 2020 are entitled to a continuous period of 10 weeks‚Äô maternity leave. (^2) Before 11 December 2020, miscarriage means the expulsion of the products of conception which are incapable of survival after being born before 28 weeks of pregnancy. \n\n\n**Payment for Maternity Leave** An employee is eligible for maternity leave pay if: \n\n1. she has been employed under a continuous contract for not less than     40 weeks immediately before the commencement of scheduled maternity     leave^3 ; \n\n2. she has given notice of pregnancy and her intention to take maternity leave     to her employer after the pregnancy has been confirmed.

Maternity leave should be paid for a period of 144 weeks and it should be paid on the normal pay day of the employee. The daily rate of maternity leave pay is a sum equivalent to four-fifths of the average daily wages earned by an employee in the 12-month period preceding the first day of the maternity leave. If an employee is employed for less than 12 months, the calculation shall be based on the shorter period. The 4-week maternity leave pay for the 11th^ to 14th^ week of the maternity leave is subject to a cap of $80,000. **Reimbursement of Maternity Leave Pay** Employers, after payment of all maternity leave pay on the normal pay day, may apply to the Government for reimbursement^5 of the 11th^ to 14th^ weeks‚Äô maternity leave pay payable and paid under the Employm",

(see Appendix 1 for details) \n\n\n**Termination of Employment Contract Without Notice or Payment in",
      " lieu of Notice** An employer may summarily dismiss an employee without notice or payment in lieu of notice if the employee, in relation to his employment: \n\n1. wilfully disobeys a lawful and reasonable order; \n\n2. misconducts himself; \n\n3. is guilty of fraud or dishonesty; or \n\n4. is habitually neglectful in his duties. Taking part by an employee in a strike is not a lawful ground for an employer to terminate the employee's contract of employment without notice or payment in lieu. \n\n**NOTE:** (^) **Summary dismissal is a serious disciplinary action. It only applies to cases where an employee has committed very serious misconduct or fails to improve himself after the employer's repeated warnings.** An employee may terminate his employment contract without notice or payment in lieu of notice if: \n\n1. he reasonably fears physical danger by violence or disease; \n\n2. he is subjected to ill-treatment by the employer; or \n\n3. he has been employed for not less than five years and is certified",
      " by registered     medical practitioner or a registered Chinese medicine practitioner as being     permanently unfit for the type of work he is being engaged (see Chapter 11). \n\n\n**Statutory Restrictions on Termination of Employment Contract** An employer shall not dismiss an employee under the following circumstances: **Maternity protection** An employer shall not dismiss a female employee who has been confirmed pregnant and has served a notice of pregnancy. **Paid sick leave** An employer shall not dismiss an employee whilst the employee is on paid sick leave. **Giving evidence or information to the authorities** An employer shall not dismiss an employee by reason of his giving of evidence or information in any proceedings or inquiry in connection with the enforcement of the Employment Ordinance, work accidents or breach of work safety legislation. **Trade union activities** An employer shall not dismiss an employee for trade union membership and activities. **Injury at work** An emp",
      "loyer shall not dismiss an injured employee before having entered into an agreement with the employee for employee's compensation or before the issue of a certificate of assessment. **Offences and Penalties** An employer dismissing an employee under the above circumstances is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $100,000. \n\n\n**Termination Payments** The items and amount of payments payable to an employee on termination of employment or expiry of the contract depend on a number of factors such as the length of service, the terms of employment contract and the reason for termination of contract. For quick reference, termination payments usually include: \n\n- outstanding wages; \n\n- payment in lieu of notice, if any; \n\n- payment in lieu of any untaken annual leave, and any pro rata annual leave     pay for the current leave year; \n\n- any outstanding sum of end of year payment, and pro rata end of year     payment for the current payment period; \n\n- where appropriate, lon",

For severance payment, an employer shall make payment not later than two months from the receipt of a notice from an employee claiming for severance payment. **Offences and Penalties** An employer is required to pay interest on the outstanding wages due to the employee if he fails to pay wages to the employee within seven days after the termination or expiry of contract. An employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay termination payments when they become due is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $350,000 and to imprisonment for thr",
      "ee years. \n\n\n### Chapter 10: Employment Protection \n\nThe Part on Employment Protection of the Employment Ordinance aims at discouraging employers from dismissing or varying the terms of the employment contract of their employees in order to evade their liabilities under the Ordinance. **Eligibility and Remedies for Employment Protection** An employee may claim for remedies against an employer under the following situations: **Situation Conditions Remedies** Unreasonable Dismissal \n\n1. the employee has been     employed under a     continuous contract for a     period of not less than     24 months; and \n\n2. the employee is     dismissed other than for     a valid reason as     specified in the     Ordinance \n\n- An order for     reinstatement or re-     engagement; or \n\n- An award of     terminal payments Unreasonable Variation of the Terms of the Employment Contract \n\n1. the employee has been     employed under a     continuous contract; \n\n2. the terms of the     employment contract ar",
      "e     varied without the     employee's consent; \n\n3. the employment contract     does not contain an     express term which     allows such a variation;     and \n\n4. the terms of the     employment contract are     varied other than for a     valid reason as specified     in the Ordinance \n\n\n Situation Conditions Remedies Unreasonable and Unlawful Dismissal \n\n1. the employee is     dismissed other than for     a valid reason as     specified in the     Ordinance; and \n\n2. the dismissal is in     contravention of the law     (see the part on     ‚ÄúStatutory Restrictions on     Termination of     Employment Contract‚Äù in     Chapter 9) \n\n- An order for     reinstatement or     re-engagement; or \n\n- An award of     terminal payments     and / or award of     compensation not     exceeding     $150,000 **Valid Reasons for Dismissal or Variation of the Terms of the Employment Contract** The five valid reasons for dismissal or variation of the terms of the employment contract are: ÔÇü the condu",
      "ct of the employee ÔÇü the capability or qualifications of the employee for performing his work ÔÇü redundancy or other genuine operational requirements of the business ÔÇü statutory requirements (i.e. it would be contrary to the law to allow an employee to continue to work in his original position or to continue with the original terms in his employment contract) ÔÇü other substantial reasons The absence from work of an employee by reason of his / her compliance with a specific anti-epidemic requirement with a movement restriction does not constitute a valid reason for a dismissal or a variation of the terms of an employee‚Äôs employment contract by his/her employer. (see the part on specific anti-epidemic requirements with movement restriction in Chapter 5 ‚ÄúSickness Allowance‚Äù) \n\n\n**Making a Claim for Remedies for Employment Protection** An employee who wishes to claim for remedies must serve a written notice to the employer in respect of his claim within three months from the effective date o",
      "f termination of employment or variation of contract. This deadline may be extended for a further period up to six months if approved by the Commissioner for Labour. If an employee wishes to file a claim with the Labour Tribunal (‚ÄúLT‚Äù), he must do so within nine months from the effective date of termination of employment or the variation of contract. **Remedies for Employment Protection** Remedies for Employment Protection, to be awarded by LT, include an order of reinstatement or re-engagement, an award of terminal payments and an award of compensation. **Order of Reinstatement or Re-engagement** An order for reinstatement is an order requiring the employer to treat the employee in all respects as if he had not been dismissed or as if there had been no variation of the terms of the employment contract. An order for re-engagement is an order requiring the employer to re-engage the employee in an employment on terms comparable to his original terms of employment or in other suitable emp",
      "loyment. An order for re-engagement may be varied by LT on application by the employee and with the agreement of the parties concerned to the effect that engagement of the employee by a successor or associated company of the original employer is to be treated as re-engagement by the original employer in compliance with the re-engagement order. For unreasonable dismissal and unreasonable variation of the terms of the employment contract, an order for reinstatement or re-engagement will only be made if both the employer and the employee agree to it. For unreasonable and unlawful dismissal^1 , if LT considers the order is appropriate and reinstatement or re-engagement of the employee by the employer is reasonably practicable, such order can be made without the need to secure the employer‚Äôs agreement. \n\n(^1) Where an employee has been unreasonably and unlawfully dismissed before 19 October 2018, an order for reinstatement or re-engagement will only be made if both the employer and the empl",
      "oyee agree to it. \n\n\n**NOTE:** If the employer eventually does not reinstate or re-engage the employee as required by the order, the employer must pay to the employee a further sum, amounting to three times the employee‚Äôs average monthly wages* and subject to a ceiling of $72,500, on top of the monetary remedies payable to the employee as ordered by LT. (* see Appendix 1 for details of calculation) Where an employee is ordered to be reinstated or re-engaged, his rights and privileges, including seniority and pension rights, must be restored to him and the continuity of the period of employment shall not be treated as broken. The employer may also be ordered to pay the employee any arrears of pay and statutory entitlements under the Employment Ordinance which the employee would have accrued if he has not been dismissed or his terms of employment contract has not been varied. Conversely, the employee may be ordered to pay the employer any amount that the employer has paid him because of ",
      "the dismissal or the variation of the terms of the employment contract. **Award of Terminal Payments** If no order for reinstatement or re-engagement is made, LT may make an award of terminal payments to be payable by the employer to the employee as it considers fair and appropriate. Terminal payments means: 1) the statutory entitlements under the Employment Ordinance which the employee is entitled to but has not yet been paid upon dismissal; 2) the entitlements the employee might reasonably be expected to be entitled to under the Employment Ordinance had he been allowed to continue his employment; and 3) any other payments due to the employee under his contract of employment. An employee may be awarded terminal payments even if he has not attained the qualifying length of service required for the entitlements. In such case, the terminal payments shall be calculated according to his actual length of service. **Award of Compensation** An employee may be awarded compensation up to a maxi",
      "mum of $150,000 if he is unreasonably and unlawfully dismissed, and no order for reinstatement or reengagement is made by LT. In determining the award of compensation, LT will consider the circumstances of \n\n\na claim including: \n\n1. the circumstances of the employer and the employee; \n\n2. the period of employment of the employee; \n\n3. how the dismissal took place; \n\n4. the loss sustained by the employee as a result of the dismissal; \n\n5. possibility of the employee obtaining new employment; \n\n6. whether the employee should bear any fault for the dismissal; and \n\n7. any payments, including terminal payments, that the employee is entitled to     receive in respect of the dismissal. **Exclusion** This Part of the Employment Ordinance does not apply to claims involving dismissal on the grounds of sex, disability, family status or race. If an employee is dismissed on the grounds of sex, disability, family status or race, he may claim for remedies under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, the ",
      "Disability Discrimination Ordinance, the Family Status Discrimination Ordinance or the Race Discrimination Ordinance respectively. \n\n\n### Chapter 11: Severance Payment and Long Service Payment \n\n**Eligibility for Severance Payment / Long Service Payment** An employee is eligible for severance payment or long service payment subject to the following conditions: **Entitlement Severance Payment Long Service Payment** Qualifying period of employment Not less than 24 months under a continuous contract Not less than 5 years under a continuous contract Conditions / Requirements ÔÇü The employee is dismissed by reason of redundancy* ÔÇü The employee is dismissed but: \n\n- he is not summarily     dismissed due to his     serious misconduct \n\n- his dismissal is not by     reason of redundancy ÔÇü Employment contract of a fixed term expires without being renewed by reason of redundancy* ÔÇü Employment contract of a fixed term expires without being renewed* ÔÇü The employee is laid off ÔÇü The employee dies ÔÇü ",
      "The employee resigns on ground of ill health ÔÇü The employee, aged 65 or above, resigns * If not less than 7 days before the date of dismissal / expiry of the fixed term contract in case of severance payment, and not less than 7 days before the expiry of the fixed term contract in case of long service payment, the employer has offered in writing to renew the contract of employment or re-engage him under a new contract but the employee has unreasonably refused the offer, the employee is not eligible for the entitlements. \n\n\n**NOTE:** An employee will not be simultaneously entitled to both long service payment and severance payment. **Meaning of Redundancy** An employee is taken to be dismissed by reason of redundancy if the dismissal is due to the fact that: \n\n- the employer closes or intends to close his business; \n\n- the employer has ceased, or intends to cease, the business in the place     where the employee was employed; or \n\n- the requirement of the business for employees to carry ",
      "out work of a particular     kind, or for the employee to carry out work of a particular kind in the place     where the employee was employed, ceases or diminishes or is expected to     cease or diminish. **Meaning of Lay-off** If an employee is employed on such terms and conditions that his remuneration depends on his being provided by the employer with work of the kind he is employed to do, he shall be taken to be laid off if the total number of days on which no work is provided and no wages is paid exceeds: \n\n- half of the total number of normal working days in any four consecutive     weeks; or \n\n- one-third of the total number of normal working days in any 26 consecutive     weeks. The days of lock-out, rest days, annual leave and statutory holidays should not be counted as normal working days during the above periods. \n\n\n**Amount of Severance Payment / Long Service Payment** The following formula applies to the calculation of both severance payment and long service payment: **Mo",
      "nthly-paid employee Daily-rated / piece-rated employee** Service of an incomplete year should be calculated on a pro rata basis. * An employee may also elect to use his average wages in the 12 months immediately preceding the termination of employment contract for the calculation. (Where the employee's employment contract is terminated by payment in lieu of notice, the employee may elect to use his average wages in the 12 months immediately preceding the date up to which the payment in lieu of notice is calculated.) \n\n# (^) The sum should not exceed 2/3 of $22,500 (i.e. $15,000). **Reckonable Years of Service** For all manual employees and non-manual employees whose average monthly wages did not exceed $15,000 for the 12 months preceding 8 June 1990, if the relevant date of termination of employment occurs on or after 1 October 2004, the years of service should be reckoned in full. For non-manual employees whose average monthly wages exceeded $15,000 for the 12 months preceding 8 June ",
      "1990, their years of service can be reckoned up to 1980. **Maximum Amount** If the relevant date of termination of employment occurs on or after 1 October 2003, the maximum amount of severance payment or long service payment is $390,000. **Payment of Severance Payment** An employee who wishes to claim for severance payment should serve a written notice to his employer within three months after the dismissal / lay off takes effect. The deadline for serving such notice may be extended if approved by the reckonable X years of service (last full month‚Äôs wages* X 2/3) # reckonable X years of service (any 18 days' wages* chosen by the employee out of his last 30 normal working days) # \n\n\nCommissioner for Labour. The employer shall make the severance payment to the employee not later than two months from the receipt of such a notice. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to pay severance payment to an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction,",
      " to a fine of $50,000. **Payment of Long Service Payment** Long service payment should be paid to an employee within seven days after the date of termination of employment contract. **Offences and Penalties** An employer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse fails to pay long service payment to an employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $350,000 and to imprisonment for three years. **Offsetting of Severance Payment / Long Service Payment against Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme benefit, Occupational Retirement Scheme benefit or Gratuity based on length of service** If an employee becomes entitled to severance payment or long service payment and: \n\n- gratuities based on length of service or occupational retirement scheme     benefits (excluding any part attributable to employee's contributions) have     been paid to the employee; or \n\n- accrued benefit (excluding any part attributable to employee's contributions)     is being held in a mandatory providen",
      "t fund scheme in respect of the     employee, or has been paid to the employee, the severance payment / long service payment is to be offset against the aforementioned amount of gratuities and benefits to the extent that they relate to the employees' years of service for which the severance payment / long service payment is payable. (For enquiries on application for payment of an amount from the occupational retirement scheme benefits or accrued benefit in the mandatory provident fund scheme due to severance payment / long service payment paid / payable to an employee, please contact the trustees concerned for details.) \n\n\n**Claiming Long Service Payment on the ground of Ill Health** An employee claiming for long service payment on ground of ill health should forward to the employer a certificate in a specified form issued by a registered medical practitioner or a registered Chinese medicine practitioner, certifying that he is permanently unfit for his present job. Regardless of whethe",
      "r the certificate produced by the employee was issued by a registered medical practitioner or registered Chinese medicine practitioner, an employer may, within 14 days after receiving such certificate, at the employer‚Äôs own expense, arrange for the employee to attend another medical examination conducted by a registered medical practitioner or registered Chinese medicine practitioner named by the employer to obtain a second opinion as to the employee‚Äôs permanent unfitness to undertake the work at issue. The employer should notify the employee in writing details of the appointment not later than 48 hours before the examination is to take place. **Claiming Long Service Payment in the event of the Death of an Employee Priority in claiming long service payment** 1 st^ the spouse of the deceased employee 2 nd^ children of the deceased employee (if two or more persons apply, the long service payment should be divided equally between them) 3 rd^ parents of the deceased employee (if two or mor",

Where necessary, the Commissioner for Labour may extend the deadline. The form can be obtained at any branch office of the Labour Relations Division of the Labour Department or downloaded from the web page of the Labour Department. \n\n\nThe employer shall make the payment of Long Service Payment to: **The spouse of the employee** within 7 days after receiving the application **Other applicants** within 7 days after the application period expires **Offences and Penalties** An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to pay long service payment to the beneficiaries of a deceased employee is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of $50,000. \n\n",

The main objective of the E(A)O 2007 is to ensure that all components of wages^2 as defined under the Employment Ordinance (including commission and allowance, etc) are included in the calculation of relevant statutory entitlements. Upon commencement of the E(A)O 2007, regardless of whether an employee is monthly, daily or piece rated, his relevant statutory entitlements shall be calculated on the basis of his 12-month average wages; and in computing his average wages, any periods and wages that fall under the ‚Äúdisregardin",

(^6) Month‚Äù refers to ‚Äúcalendar month‚Äù. (^7) Suppose an employee commenced employment on 5 July 2007, his period of employment will be less than 12 calendar months before 4 April 2008 (i.e. Ching Ming Festival). His holiday pay for 4 April 2008 shall therefore be calculated on the basis of his average daily wages earned in the period 5 July 2007 and 31 March 2008. \n\n\n The specified dates of the relevant statutory entitlements are: Statutory Entitlements Day(s) of Leave Specified Dates Holiday Pay 1 day Day of the statutory holiday More than 1 consecutive day First day of the statutory holidays Annual Leave Pay 1 day Day of the annual leave More than 1 consecutive day First day of the annual leave Day(s) of untak",

By doing so, an employer does not have to exclude his employee‚Äôs full-paid leave (be it statutory holiday, annual leave, maternity leave, paternity leave or any other leave taken with agreement of the employer) as well as the sum paid correspondingly when calculating average wages. It is noteworthy that th",
